# Automatic-Medicine-Prescription-using-BART-integrated-with-flask-and-reactjs
A Flask web application that serves as an interface for a medical chatbot. The chatbot predicts and provides information about possible diseases based on symptoms input by the user. It uses a decision tree classifier and a trie data structure for efficient word searching. Additionally, it incorporates functionality to recommend precautions, and severity, and generate reports based on the symptoms. The application also leverages the BART model for predicting medicines. The web app exposes endpoints for processing chat, predicting diseases, and recommending medicines.
